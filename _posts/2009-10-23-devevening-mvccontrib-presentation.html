Yesterday I did a presentation at <a href="http://www.devevening.co.uk/">DevEvening</a> on using <a href="http://mvccontrib.org">MvcContrib</a> with ASP.NET MVC applications.
</p>
<p>
I demonstrated the use of FluentHtml (with behaviours), the Grid and Pager components, the ActionResult assertions and the route testing extensions.
