This Wednesday I'm going to be giving a live presentation on using <a href="http://fluentvalidation.codeplex.com">FluentValidation</a> for the <a href="http://www.c4mvc.net/">c4mvc virtual usergroup</a>.
</p>
<p>
The session will be live from 18:00 GMT (12:00 CST) and will last about 40 minutes. I'll be covering the basics of using FluentValidation as well as how you can integrate it with ASP.NET MVC applications.
