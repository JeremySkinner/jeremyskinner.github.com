<p>Red Gate <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/announcement">recently announced</a> that as of v7, Reflector would no longer be available for free. As expected, this created quite a controversy amongst the .NET developer community as Reflector has always had a free version.</p>  <p>Personally, I don’t have any problem with Red Gate charging for the new Reflector v7 – it looks like it’ll have some pretty cool <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/bart/archive/2011/01/10/98258.aspx">new features</a> (decompiling iterators is long overdue). The thing that concerned me was that the existing free edition of v6 is time-bombed to stop working once v7 is released. I would have very much liked to see the v6 free edition to stay around for a while – even if it’s in a non-supported, non-maintained capacity. </p>  <p>Since the announcement, Red Gate contacted me (via the <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/our-company/about/community-relations/friends-of-rg">Friends of Red Gate</a> program) and asked me whether I’d be interested in giving away some licences for Reflector 7. I said yes, so I now have 50 free licences of Reflector 7 to give away. I’m limiting these to developers of Open Source projects or educational institutions. If you meet one of these criteria, keep reading…</p>  <p>If you’re the coordinator of a .NET open source project and would like a free Reflector 7 licence then please email me at <strong>reflector (at) jeremyskinner.co.uk </strong>with the following information:</p>  <ul>   <li>Your name </li>    <li>The name of your OSS project </li>    <li>The URL of the project (it must be an *active* project) </li>    <li>A URL to the page on the project’s site that identifies you as the project owner/coordinator </li> </ul>  <p>If you’re a developer or teacher working at an educational institution and you would like a free Reflector 7 license then please email me at <strong>reflector (at) jeremyskinner.co.uk</strong> with the following details:</p>  <ul>   <li>Your name </li>    <li>The name of the educational institution </li>    <li>Your job title (developer, professor, teacher etc) </li>    <li>Please ensure that you send me the email from your educational institution’s email address </li> </ul>  <p>I’ll give these licenses away on a first-come-first-serve basis, so be sure to get in quick.</p>
