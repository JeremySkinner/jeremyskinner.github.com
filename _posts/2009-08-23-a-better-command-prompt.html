Now that I've started using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, I've found myself using the command line a lot more for every-day tasks. My command shell of choice is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">Windows PowerShell</a>, which is a lot more powerful than the antiquated cmd.exe. 
</p>
<p>
There are two tools that I've found make PowerShell significantly easier to use. The first is <a href="http://thepowershellguy.com/blogs/posh/pages/powertab.aspx">PowerTab</a> which provides IntelliSense-like autocompletion for directory paths, PowerShell commands and .NET types.

<p>
The second tool that I use is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/">Console</a> which is an application that can host a variety of shells including cmd.exe, bash and PowerShell.

<a href="http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Console.jpg">

<p>
My two favourite features of Console are its improved copy/paste support and the ability to have tabbed shells.
