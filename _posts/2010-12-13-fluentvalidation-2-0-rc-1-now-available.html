<p>FluentValidation 2.0 RC1 is <a href="http://fluentvalidation.codeplex.com/releases/view/57304">now available for download</a>. </p>  <p>The biggest change in this release is the addition of the <strong>WithLocalizedName</strong> method which supports localizing only the name portion of a validation message (previously, you would have to override the entire message if you wanted it to use custom resources).</p>  <p>Summary of changes since 2.0 beta 2:</p>  <ul>   <li>Updated MVC integration to work with MVC3 RC2 </li>    <li>Allow custom MVC ModelValidators to be added to the FluentValidationModelValidatorProvider </li>    <li>Support using a resource provider for custom property validators through the new IResourceAccessorBuilder interface </li>    <li>Added WithLocalizedName as a counterpart to WithLocalizedMessage </li>    <li>Deprecated the WithPropertyName method as it was misleading. Depending on your scenario, you should either use WithName or OverridePropertyName instead. </li>    <li>Renamed IErrorMessageSource and its derivatives to IStringSource (breaking change) </li> </ul>  <p>All changes since 1.3: </p>  <ul>   <li>Removed the v1.1 backwards compatibility layer. If you’re still using old-style custom validators (which were marked as Obsolete since v1.2), you will need to upgrade. </li>    <li>Silverlight assembly renamed to FluentValidation.dll for consistency (formerly was FluentValidation.Silverlight.dll) </li>    <li>Provide more useful information in ValidationException error message. </li>    <li>Removed old mechanism for specifying cascade mode. Use .Cascade(cascadeMode) instead </li>    <li>FluentValidatorModelMetadataProvider now converts NotNull/NotEmpty validators to IsRequired in metadata. </li>    <li>Patch – updated German localization </li>    <li>Using a child validator on a collection will now skip items in the collection that are null. </li>    <li>NotEmptyValidator can now work against empty collections (for collections that implement ICollection) </li>    <li>Performance improvements to AttributedValidatorFactory </li>    <li>Fixed an issue where CascadeMode values are ignored if they’re changed after the rules have been defined. </li>    <li>Ported FluentValidation to WP7. </li>    <li>ShouldHaveChildValidator test helper now works with child collection validators </li>    <li>Simplified the implementation of SetValidator. </li> </ul>
