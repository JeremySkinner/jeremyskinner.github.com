<p>
FluentValidation 3.2 is now <a href="http://fluentvalidation.codeplex.com/releases/view/76821">available for download</a>.
</p>
<p>This is a maintenance release that addresses a couple of bugs from FluentValidation 3.1:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The NotEmptyValidator can now be used with collections that don't implement ICollection (such as Entity Framework's EntityCollection&lt;T&gt;)</li>
	<li>AbstractValidator.Custom can now be used within RuleSets.</li>
</ul>
