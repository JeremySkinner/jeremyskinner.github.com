<p>Last month I wrote about using <a href="http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/2010/03/07/using-git-with-windows-powershell/">git with Windows Powershell</a> by making use of a custom prompt function as well as tab expansion. My sample code for the git tab expansion and <a href="http://www.markembling.info/view/git-powershell-revisited">Mark’s custom prompt</a> are now available on GitHub in the <a href="http://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git">posh-git project</a>.</p>  <p>I’ve also ported both the prompt and the tab expansion to work with <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com">Mercurial</a>. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/image.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/image_thumb.png" width="530" height="292" /></a> </p>  <p>Much like the git prompt, the Mercurial prompt shows the name of the branch as well as other information. The prompt shows the following information:</p>  <ul>   <li>“hg” – Identifies this as a mercurial repository (so I can tell whether I’m using git or mercurial) </li>    <li>“default” – We’re currently on the “default” branch </li>    <li>“+&lt;number&gt;” – Number of files that have been added but not yet committed </li>    <li>“~&lt;number&gt;” – Number of files that have been modified but not yet committed </li>    <li>“-&lt;number&gt;” – Number of files that have been removed but not yet committed </li>    <li>“?&lt;number&gt;” – Number of untracked files in the repository </li>    <li>“!&lt;number&gt;” – Number of missing files </li> </ul>  <p>I’ve also written some basic tab expansion functionality that provides completion for hg commands as well as hgtk commands (the <a href="http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/">TortoiseHg</a> command line tool).</p>  <p>Code can be found in the <a href="http://github.com/jeremyskinner/posh-hg">posh-hg repository</a> (somewhat ironically hosted on GitHub).</p>
