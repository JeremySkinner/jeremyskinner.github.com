<p>I was recently involved in interviewing several candidates for a .NET developer job.  This is the first time I've really been involved in interviewing and here are some initial thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you say you know C# on your CV, I expect you to know it.</li>
<li>If you don't understand a question or get stuck on a test, ask for clarification.</li>
<li>Just because someone has a Microsoft Certification doesn't automatically make them a great developer. </li>
<li>Not being able to diagnose the cause of a simple NullReferenceException (when you have access to a debugger and the internet) is worrying.</li>
<li>Don't just tell me what I want to hear - be honest.</li>
<li>Being able to show and demonstrate a project you've worked on creates a great impression.</li>
<li>Not being able to explain the last project you worked on creates a very bad impression.</li>
</ul>
