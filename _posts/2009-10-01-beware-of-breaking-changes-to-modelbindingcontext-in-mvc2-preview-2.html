<p>
ASP.NET MVC2 Preview 2 was released <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2009/10/01/asp.net-mvc-preview-2-released.aspx">earlier today</a>. One thing to be aware of is the breaking changes to the ModelBindingContext. 
</p>
<p>
Both the <strong>Model</strong> and <strong>ModelType</strong> properties are obsolete and their setters throw exceptions. However, they are <strong>not marked with the obsolete attribute</strong> so you will not get a compiler warning if you are using them - you will only get an exception at runtime.
