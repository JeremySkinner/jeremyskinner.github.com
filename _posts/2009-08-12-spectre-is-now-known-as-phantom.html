<p>
Since my <a href="http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/2009/08/11/introducing-spectre/">last post</a> on my Boo-based build system named 'Spectre' it was pointed out to me that there is another project called 'Specter' <a href="http://specter.sourceforge.net">also written in Boo</a>. 
</p>
<p>
To avoid confusion, I have renamed my Spectre to 'Phantom'. The updated source <a href="http://github.com/JeremySkinner/Phantom">can be found on GitHub</a>.
